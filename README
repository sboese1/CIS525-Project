Output: Once a user starts the chat client, they are to enter a nickname. After that, they can pick a room to join.
	Once that nickname is entered both of those are entered, they are announced in the chat to every
	other connected client (the first connected client gets a message stating that they are the first client). 
	Likewise happens when they disconnect. After this, they are free to either type a message in the chat by prefacing 
	each input with 'C' or change their nickname with 'N'. Both these will be broadcasted to every other connected client.
